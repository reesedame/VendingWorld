#### Disclaimer

This project was created following a homework assignment for CS1332 at Georgia Tech. I found this course's materials online and utilized the lecture slides and notes to create this project. 

I wrote `VendingItem.java` and `VendingMachine.java` but `VendingWorld.java` was provided as a part of the assignment. The full assignment description can be found [here](https://cs1331.gitlab.io/fall2018/hw3/hw3-vending-machine.html).
